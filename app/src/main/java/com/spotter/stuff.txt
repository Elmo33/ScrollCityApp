Spotter is a niche social media platform designed to help users discover local entertainment
spots—like bars, clubs, game rooms, and go-kart tracks through short, engaging videos (30 to 60 seconds).
Businesses upload these clips, showcasing their venue or activity, and users scroll through them in a TikTok-style
feed. By leveraging filters, tags (e.g., #travel, #tbilisi), and an algorithmic recommendation system,
Spotter aims to surface hidden gems that people might not otherwise find on larger platforms. The core
selling point is easing the discovery process for users who don’t even know what to search for, letting
them “scroll to discover” rather than actively typing in keywords. While critics argue that major
social media networks already serve similar content, Spotter’s focus on niche, local experiences
sets it apart, albeit with the challenge of needing strong marketing and creative advertising to build
an initial user base.
